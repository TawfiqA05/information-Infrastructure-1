TawfiqA05: What is the average number of deaths and hospitalizations for each month in the dataset?
use python only. 
dont use any import statements.

GitHub Copilot: To calculate the average number of deaths and hospitalizations for each month in the dataset using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Read the CSV data.
2. Parse the data to extract the month and year.
3. Aggregate the deaths and hospitalizations by month.
4. Calculate the average for each month.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```python

# Print the results
for year_month, avg_deaths in average_deaths.items():
    print(f"{year_month}: Average Deaths = {avg_deaths:.2f}")
```

This code will output the average number of deaths for each month in the dataset. Note that the dataset provided does not include hospitalizations, so the code only calculates the average deaths. If hospitalizations were included, you would follow a similar approach to calculate their averages.

    for line in file:

        if deaths_str == '':
            continue
        
        deaths = float(deaths_str)

        # Extract year and month from the date string

TawfiqA05: have it linked to the us_countries_covid19_daily.csv file and make it fully functioning 

GitHub Copilot: Here's the complete script linked to the `us_countries_covid19_daily.csv` file, making it fully functional:

```python
# Load the dataset from a CSV file
file_path = 'us_countries_covid19_daily.csv'  # Ensure this file is in the same directory or provide the correct path

# Initialize dictionaries to store total deaths and counts per month
monthly_deaths = {}
monthly_counts = {}

# Open the CSV file and process it
with open(file_path, mode='r') as file:
    # Read the header
    header = file.readline().strip().split(',')
    
    # Find the indices of the 'date' and 'deaths' columns
    date_idx = header.index('date')
    deaths_idx = header.index('deaths')

        monthly_counts[year_month] += 1

# Calculate the average deaths for each month
average_deaths = {}
for year_month in monthly_deaths:
    average_deaths[year_month] = monthly_deaths[year_month] / monthly_counts[year_month]

# Print the results
for year_month, avg_deaths in average_deaths.items():
    print(f"{year_month}: Average Deaths = {avg_deaths:.2f}")
```

Make sure the `us_countries_covid19_daily.csv` file is in the same directory as your script or provide the correct path to the file. This script will read the CSV file, process the data, and print the average number of deaths for each month.
