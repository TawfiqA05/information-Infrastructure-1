TawfiqA05: without inporting at libraries What is the average number of deaths and hospitalizations for each month in the dataset

GitHub Copilot: To calculate the average number of deaths and hospitalizations for each month in the dataset without importing any libraries, you can manually parse the CSV data and perform the necessary calculations. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Read the CSV data line by line.
2. Parse each line to extract the date, deaths, and hospitalizations.
3. Group the data by month.
4. Calculate the average number of deaths and hospitalizations for each month.

Since the provided data does not include hospitalizations, I will only calculate the average number of deaths.

### Pseudocode
1. Initialize a dictionary to store the sum of deaths and count of entries for each month.
2. Loop through each line of the CSV data.
3. Skip the header line.
4. For each line, extract the date and deaths.
5. Convert the date to a month identifier (e.g., "2020-01").
6. Update the dictionary with the sum of deaths and count of entries for the corresponding month.
7. After processing all lines, calculate the average deaths for each month.
8. Print the results.

TawfiqA05: generlize it for the whole entire dataset

GitHub Copilot: To generalize the code for the entire dataset, you need to ensure that the data is read from the file and processed accordingly. Here is the complete code to calculate the average number of deaths and hospitalizations for each month in the dataset:

### Pseudocode
1. Open the dataset file and read its contents.
2. Initialize a dictionary to store the sum of deaths and count of entries for each month.
3. Loop through each line of the CSV data.
4. Skip the header line.
5. For each line, extract the date, deaths, and hospitalizations.
6. Convert the date to a month identifier (e.g., "2020-01").
7. Update the dictionary with the sum of deaths and hospitalizations, and count of entries for the corresponding month.
8. After processing all lines, calculate the average deaths and hospitalizations for each month.
9. Print the results.

### Code
```python
# Open the dataset file and read its contents
with open('path_to_your_dataset.csv', 'r') as file:
    data = file.readlines()

# Initialize a dictionary to store the sum of deaths and hospitalizations, and count of entries for each month
monthly_data = {}

# Process each line
for line in data[1:]:  # Skip the header line
    parts = line.strip().split(',')
    date = parts[0]
    deaths = float(parts[5])
    hospitalizations = float(parts[6]) if len(parts) > 6 else 0  # Assuming hospitalizations are in the 7th column
    
    # Extract the month from the date
    month = date[:7]
    
    if month not in monthly_data:
        monthly_data[month] = {'deaths_sum': 0, 'hospitalizations_sum': 0, 'count': 0}
    
    monthly_data[month]['deaths_sum'] += deaths
    monthly_data[month]['hospitalizations_sum'] += hospitalizations
    monthly_data[month]['count'] += 1

# Calculate and print the average deaths and hospitalizations for each month
for month, data in monthly_data.items():
    avg_deaths = data['deaths_sum'] / data['count']
    avg_hospitalizations = data['hospitalizations_sum'] / data['count']
    print(f"{month}: Average Deaths = {avg_deaths:.2f}, Average Hospitalizations = {avg_hospitalizations:.2f}")
```

Replace `'path_to_your_dataset.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset file. This code will read the entire dataset, process it, and calculate the average number of deaths and hospitalizations for each month.
